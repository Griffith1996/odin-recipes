        <p>Is a <strong>traditional</strong> <em>Neapolitan</em> pasta that is popular for being inexpensive and using pantry ingredients, while being utterly delicious.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound dried spaghetti</li>
                <li>¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>12 large garlic cloves, cut into thin slivers</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for serving</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
                <li>⅓ cup fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving</li>
                <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and add spaghetti, cooking until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta water.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a large pan, heat olive oil over medium-low. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 3 minutes.

                <li>Remove pan from heat, add parsley, lemon juice, and Parmesan and toss well. Check for flavor, adding more salt if necessary. Garnish with more Parmesan, lemon wedges, and crushed red pepper flakes.</li>
