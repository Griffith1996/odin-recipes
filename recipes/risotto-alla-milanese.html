        <p>Is a classic dish from the <strong>Lombardy region of northern</strong> <strong><em>Italy</strong></em>. It's said to have come about in the mid-1800s,</p>
        <p>when a team of glassmakers took some of the saffron they were using to color the stained glass windows in Milan's Duomo cathedral and added it to the risotto being served at dinner.</p>
        <p>What started as a prank became one of the most iconic Italian plates.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a simmer; keep warm.</li>
                <li>In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes,</li>
                <li>Add the rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring to thoroughly coat.</li>
                <li>Crumble the saffron into the wine.</li>
                <li>Add the saffron and wine mixture to the rice.</li>
                <li>Cook, stirring, until the wine is absorbed</li>
                <li>Add 1 cup of the warm stock and cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until nearly absorbed.</li>

                <li>The risotto is done when the rice is al dente and suspended in a thick, creamy sauce, about 20 minutes total. Season the risotto with salt and pepper. Stir in the cheese, butter, and parsley and serve immediately.</li>
